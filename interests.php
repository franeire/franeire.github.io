			<h3>Liverpool F.C.</h3>
			<p>I have been supporting Liverpool for as long as I can remember, and have lived through the long barren spells where we werent winning much, however the recent past has somewhat made up for this.</p>
			<p>I try to get over to games as often as possible, but at least two to three times a year. As great as getting to occasionally see the mighty reds play in friendlies in the Aviva, nothing compares to a matchday in Anfield</p>

			<h3>Music</h3>
			<p>Music is also another huge part of my life, I listen to a wide variety of music, but one staple has stayed with me above all other, indie music, particularly from the Madchester era of the late 80's to early 90's in Manchester.</p>
			<p>Bands like Stone Roses, Happy Mondays, Joy Division, New Order, The Charlatans. I can always listen to their music and have been to see them live on lots of occasions.</p>
			<p>I've also learned how to play the guitar, although admiteddly I'm not very good, but it doesnt stop me enjoying it to relax.</p>

			<h3>Cycling</h3>
			<p>I've never been a big fan of gyms, so even though I would like to say I only eat all the right things and lift weights etc. five times a week, thats never been a part of my life.</p>
			<p>Although not a pinnacle of fitness, I do try to balance this out by cycling to work when possible and also cycling two to three times a week as well. It is a good cardiovascular exercise and has managed to keep the wolves from the door up to this point.</p>
